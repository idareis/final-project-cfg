        <span class="introtext">We started out as a small group of friends trying to have fun and experiment with flavours and textures. This led us to create our first customised chocolate bar, which we decided to call "Snowy cherry" - a creamy, white chocolate with cherry pieces. This proved to be so popular with our families and friends that we decided to have a go at experimenting with more flavours and building up our little company. Initially working out of one of our kitchens we decided to rent a place. Now known as Chocos and Chicas, this is our only physical shop. </span>
        <br>
        <span class="introtext">We only use sustainably sourced and organic ingredients and work closely with chocolate farmers. 
            When buying our chocolate you support their communities, as our locally based staff ensure workers are not only paid a fair salary but that working conditions adhere to a high standard and are regularly monitored. </span>

    <p>The story begins around a kitchen table on a rainy day in East London in 2005.</p>
    <p>Mia, Lorena and Anna had met whilst studying at university together but none of them were happy in their jobs. They all felt that there was something missing.</p>  

      <p>Anna had been shopping for a birthday present for a friend and was saying how difficult it was to get quality chocolate gifts that were ethically made but also had lots of choice of exciting flavours. The seed had been planted.</p> 
      
      <p>The next time the girls got together was back around the kitchen table and having fun melting chocolate and experimenting with flavours. Mia suggested mixing white chocolate with cherry pieces. It was so good the girls decided that they couldn’t keep it to themselves and decided to share it with their family and friends. Their family and friends were so impressed and kept requesting more. Lorena joked that maybe it was time they started their own chocolate business. They all got researching, getting in touch with contacts that could help get the business off the ground and ensure it was an ethical and sustainable business. That day Cheeky Choc was born. </p>
      
      <p>To spread the word about their delicious new products, Lorena got in contact with her communication marvel friend Lola who took on the task of letting the world know all about Cheeky Choc. </p>
      
      <p>By 2006 Cheeky Choc was so popular, their products so in demand, that the kitchen where they started out became far too small to accommodate the growing business. They sought new premises and found a little shop in South-East London, which they rented and called Chocos and Chicas. Although their products can be bought in selected other retailers, Chocos and Chicas is the only place other than the Cheeky Chocs website where the full range of products is available.  </p>
